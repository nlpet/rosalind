# Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring
# =======================================
#
# Given a collection of strings, a larger string containing every one of the
# smaller strings as a substring is called a superstring.
#
# By the assumption of parsimony, a shortest possible superstring over a
# collection of reads serves as a candidate chromosome.
#
# Given: At most 50 DNA strings of equal length not exceeding 1 kbp (which
# represent reads deriving from the same strand of a single linear chromosome).
#
# The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a
# unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing
# together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.
#
# Return: A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus
# corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).
